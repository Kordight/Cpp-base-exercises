# C++ Basic Exercises

Hi everyone!  
I've decided to learn `C++` again and review some basics before I start making games in Unreal Engine.  
I'll do some exercises here from my old `C++` book and one Udemy course.  
You can do whatever you want with the code in this repo.  
Enjoy! ^^

> This is a warmup before learning C++ in Unreal Engine.
