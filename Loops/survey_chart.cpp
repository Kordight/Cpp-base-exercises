/*
Task: Write a program that provides an option to sum the results of a survey in which there can be three different values.
    The input entered into the program is a survey question and three possible answers.
    The first answer is assigned a value of 1,
    the second is assigned a value of 2,
    and the third is assigned a value of 3.
    The answers are summed until the user enters then the program should show the results of the survey.
    Try to generate a bar chart, showing the results scaled to fit on the screen regardless of the number of answers given.

Possible solution: i < ( ( var * scale ) / max )
